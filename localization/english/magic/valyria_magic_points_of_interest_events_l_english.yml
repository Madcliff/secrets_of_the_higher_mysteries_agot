  zz_valyria_the_doom.0001.01.desc:0 "Under the shadow of the mighty volcanic spire of [doom_location.GetTitle.GetBaseNameNoTierNoTooltip], you stumble upon a cracked and shattered formation of black, oily stone. As you reach out to touch it, your mind expands, opening to the very horrors of the universe. With unfolding clarity, you perceive an ever-expanding horizon, and within your heart, within your very essence, a voice of a thousand voices speaks directly to you. Flashes of fire and rivers of blood surge before your vision, along with murky, tentacled horrors reaching forth from the deepest and most tortured abyss. Your mind begins to question, and your heart begins to quake. Is this how the doom unfolded? Was this something that contributed to the fall of Old Valyria?"

  zz_valyria_the_doom.0001.02.desc:0 "You have begun to explore the lands of [doom_location.GetTitle.GetBaseNameNoTierNoTooltip]. The marks of the unfathomable disaster have been carved into the landscape, remaking the very core of the world. You see gouges in the stone and formations of obsidian and basalt that hint at some kind of settlement or preparation on the slopes of the volcano. What were they doing here? What was their endeavor?\n\nThe air is stifling, and life itself seems drawn into strange stones that sit at the center of formations of black rock, leaking an oily presence you can feel—not with touch or other physical senses, but within your very soul. You know that something unfathomably wrong happened here. Some great action was undertaken, but its consequences… Perhaps in these locations lie the secrets that led to the doom of the greatest empire the world has ever known."

  zz_valyria_the_doom.0001.03.desc:0 "[doom_location.GetTitle.GetBaseNameNoTierNoTooltip] is a shattered wreck, a ruined, twisting sore on the face of reality. You can taste it on your tongue, and as you close your eyes, an unfathomable entity reaches into your dreams. Its many-mouthed tentacles are worse than the ravings of sailors who claim to have seen the Deep Ones, or even the visions of the Drowned Priests and their Drowned God.\n\nIn these moments, the legends from Asshai and the ghoulish rites of the priests of Qohor and their Black Goat seem almost tame. Yet, the reality of this place eludes your senses. You cannot quite name what is wrong, nor can you articulate what has changed. All you know is that here and now, something in the world is profoundly amiss.\n\nYou feel a pull, a tension on your mind's very grasp of the present, and as you slip further away, you see—horrified and stumbling toward realization—you simply see: the great horror beyond the starry scaffolds of the cosmos, the realities beyond the comprehension of man..."

  zz_valyria_the_doom.0001.04.desc:0 "Your travels through the blasted lands of the once-great empire have brought you to this unholy place: the ruins of [doom_location.GetTitle.GetBaseNameNoTierNoTooltip]. Oddly, the first thing you notice is the utter lack of sound. It is as if no life can bear to exist within sight of the volcano.\n\nYou also see strange stones of purest black, leaking an oily substance that seeps from their pores. Immediately, you are struck by the overwhelming sense that something essential is missing from this place—something ripped away, not just from the physical world but from the very foundation and concept of reality itself.\n\nAnd then, you feel it: the unmistakable sensation of being watched. It is not a simple gaze but a piercing scrutiny, as though your soul is being observed and dissected by a presence beyond the natural order. You feel exposed, your essence laid bare under the timeless, cosmic heavens. Something is taking you apart—diagnosing, possessing, and dispossessing you.\n\nA whisper begins to creep into your mind, insinuating itself into the core of your thoughts, speaking words not your own. What unfathomable entity has turned its gaze upon you? And how is it connected to the horror that has remade the very essence of this land?\n\n[doom_location.GetTitle.GetBaseNameNoTierNoTooltip] has been forever transformed by whatever happened here. And with a growing sense of dread, you realize that you, too, are being changed—perhaps just as terribly."

  zz_valyria_the_doom.0001.05.desc:0 "In the dark of night, with the crackling of flame, you hear a whisper just beyond the edge of your hearing. You arrived in [doom_location.GetTitle.GetBaseNameNoTierNoTooltip] at dusk, taken by the blasted scars etched into the slopes of the volcano. Setting up camp to rest from your travels, you allowed the shadows to creep in as a simple fire struggled to keep the darkness at bay.\n\nBut now, foreboding whispers have begun to infect your slumbering mind. Are they merely the echoes of your thoughts surrendering to sleep? Or are they the true whispers of something foul, infesting the remains of this accursed land?\n\nYour eyes catch the ominous shadows cast by obelisks of seeping black stone. You see the petrified remnants of a dragon, consumed by ash and flame, brought low, its bones exposed as time wore away its cocoon of death. This land is a place of horrors, a blighted, unforgiving domain.\n\nYou long to leave—to escape these torments—but you know the time is not yet right. Your horses and pack animals startle, their unease palpable, but you cannot discern the cause. Weariness overtakes you, and you let your eyes close just slightly, allowing your mind to drift away from this nightmare.\n\nAnd then you see it: the gaping maw, the writhing tentacles, the grotesque gesticulations of insatiable hunger. It is coming for you. It seeks to consume you—mind, body, and soul.\n\nYou wake with a start, heart pounding, but the shadows seem ever more alive, their silent menace pressing closer with every moment..."

  zz_valyria_the_doom.0001.06.desc:0 "Black scars mar the landscape of [doom_location.GetTitle.GetBaseNameNoTierNoTooltip]. Where once a mighty tower stood on the slopes of the mountain of fire, now only the broken remnants of a settlement remain. At first, you notice the unsettling silence, as if all life has been sucked away from this place. Not even the corrupted wildlife of this blighted land dares dwell in the shadow of the mountain.\n\nThis silence provokes an unsettling question: what truly happened here? Was the event that unfolded so far beyond the scope of mortal comprehension?\n\nAs you prepare to rest for the day, your gaze is drawn to formations of oily black stone that ring the mountain. Curiosity overtakes you, and you move closer to inspect them. With a start, you realize these fragments of stone carry a power rooted in the purely conceptual—a force that brings forth the imaginary into the real.\n\nThese are markers, bindings of a kind, designed to manifest something beyond the rational, beyond the proper boundaries of mortal understanding. Some kind of magic was wrought here—a mystery that defies explanation, pulling the unreal into the realm of actuality.\n\nYou settle in for sleep, but your thoughts remain troubled by this discovery. As your eyes close, the unease deepens, and you feel it: the gaze of an intelligence infinitely greater than your own, settling upon you with terrifying precision..."

  zz_valyria_the_doom.002.desc:0 "As the dreams born in the shadow of Valyria's ruins fester in your mind, you begin to see. You cannot say in which world this might be real, but you know that, in at least one, the beast haunting your visions sought to make Valyria its instrument of power.\n\nYou have witnessed the unfolding of rituals—rivers of blood shed to bind unrealities into the fabric of the real. The stone that weeps its black haze became, in your visions, a consuming fog so thick that life itself could not endure its arrival. But is this the truth? How could such horrors have brought about the fall of this once-mighty empire? Surely, this must be the delusion of a mind weakened by its journey into the abyss.\n\nIn other visions, you see the fires of the mountains roar to life as entities beyond mortal comprehension clashed in the conceptual space that binds the cosmos. Fire and ice sought to consume one another, and their struggle left the world scarred. In one reality, a wall of ice, taller than the grandest castle, rose to shield the world from the onslaught. In another, mountains of fire unleashed a flame so potent it burned concepts themselves into oblivion.\n\nAnd yet, in another vision, the God of your nightmares—a monstrous being of grasping maws—was invoked in pursuit of vaunted immortality. But all it brought was unfathomable magic, with fire as the vehicle of destruction and consumption.\n\nYou cannot discern which of these visions, if any, is the true reality—or if all are merely fragments of countless possibilities. But one thing you know with certainty: the Doom of Valyria was intertwined with the struggles of uncaring Star Gods, forces so vast and indifferent that they transcended human understanding.\n\nAnd having seen them, you cannot unsee. Having glimpsed their forms, you feel yourself irrevocably changed. Something in your very essence has shifted. You have become... something else, something altered at the most basic conceptual level of your being."
